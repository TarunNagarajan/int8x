# INT8 Quantization Engine

## Project Overview
The **INT8 Quantization Engine** is a software project designed to efficiently quantize machine learning models from FP32 (floating-point 32-bit) to INT8 (8-bit integer) for optimized deployment on resource-constrained devices. This engine aims to bridge the gap between high-performance model inference and hardware limitations, especially in edge devices like smartphones and embedded systems. The project will cover key topics such as quantization theory, model compression, memory management, and distributed quantization techniques.

## Project Modules

### 1. **Core Quantization Engine**
   - **Goal**: The foundation of your engine, responsible for converting FP32 weights and activations to INT8 using scaling and zero-point adjustment.
   - **Sub-modules**:
     - **FP32 to INT8 Conversion**
     - **Scaling and Zero-Point Calculation**
   - **Purpose**: This is the primary task of the project — the core functionality. All other modules build on this.

### 2. **Fixed-Point Arithmetic & Precision Management**
   - **Goal**: Implement fixed-point arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) for INT8 and fixed-point types (Q7, Q15, Q31).
   - **Sub-modules**:
     - **Fixed-Point Operations**
     - **Conversion Algorithms for Q Formats**
   - **Purpose**: Essential for maintaining numerical precision during quantization, especially when working with low-bit-width formats like INT8.

### 3. **Model Compression and Sparsity**
   - **Goal**: Combine model pruning with quantization to reduce model size without significantly impacting accuracy.
   - **Sub-modules**:
     - **Pruning Techniques (Weight Pruning)**
     - **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**
   - **Purpose**: Enables the model to become both smaller and more efficient, ensuring fast deployment on edge devices.

### 4. **Tensor Operations and Matrix Multiplication (GEMM)**
   - **Goal**: Perform optimized tensor operations and matrix multiplications using INT8 data.
   - **Sub-modules**:
     - **Optimized GEMM for INT8**
     - **SIMD-based Operations (e.g., NEON, AVX)**
   - **Purpose**: Efficient computation of basic tensor operations is essential, especially in machine learning tasks like training and inference.

### 5. **Distributed Quantization (Scaling to Large Models)**
   - **Goal**: Enable distributed quantization across multiple devices or nodes to handle large models that can't fit in memory on a single device.
   - **Sub-modules**:
     - **Distributed Quantization Algorithm**
     - **Model Parallelism and Data Parallelism Support**
   - **Purpose**: Distributed systems are essential for large-scale machine learning models. This module will allow quantization to scale across multiple machines or GPUs.

### 6. **Transfer Learning with Quantization**
   - **Goal**: Allow quantization to be applied on models that have been fine-tuned using transfer learning.
   - **Sub-modules**:
     - **Quantization for Transfer Learning Models**
     - **Fine-Tuning Quantized Models**
   - **Purpose**: Transfer learning is a key strategy for many ML models, and being able to efficiently quantize these models enhances their usability in real-world applications.

### 7. **ML Framework Integration (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)**
   - **Goal**: Ensure that the quantization engine can work seamlessly with popular machine learning frameworks.
   - **Sub-modules**:
     - **TensorFlow Integration**
     - **PyTorch Integration**
   - **Purpose**: Integration with these frameworks will enable users to apply quantization directly to their pre-trained models without needing to manually adjust the code.

### 8. **Performance Benchmarking and Validation**
   - **Goal**: Track the performance (accuracy, speed, memory usage) of models before and after quantization.
   - **Sub-modules**:
     - **Benchmarking for Accuracy and Speed**
     - **Memory Usage Analysis**
   - **Purpose**: Benchmarking is vital to ensuring that the quantization process doesn't degrade the model’s accuracy significantly, and that it performs efficiently in real-world use cases.

### 9. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Goal**: Ensure the robustness of your quantization engine through extensive testing and validation.
   - **Sub-modules**:
     - **Unit Testing for Quantization Modules**
     - **Integration Testing for End-to-End Pipeline**
   - **Purpose**: Testing ensures that the engine works as expected under various conditions and maintains model integrity after quantization.

### 10. **Documentation and Tutorials**
   - **Goal**: Provide comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples to help users understand how to use the quantization engine effectively.
   - **Sub-modules**:
     - **Documentation on API Usage**
     - **Example Projects with Quantization Integration**
   - **Purpose**: Clear documentation makes your project more accessible to a wider audience, increasing its usefulness and adoption.
