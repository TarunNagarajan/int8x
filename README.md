# int8x
INT8x, a high-performance quantization engine written in low-level C++, designed to convert and optimize floating-point neural network operations into INT8 fixed-point computations. This drastically improves performance and memory efficiency on edge devices like the Raspberry Pi (ARM Cortex-A53)
